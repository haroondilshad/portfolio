# Portfolio & Projects

Here are some of the notable projects and contributions I've worked on throughout my career.

## Featured Projects

### Secure Agentic Development Environments
An ongoing initiative to make AI-assisted development safe by default. Built hardened DevContainer and DevPod configurations with sandboxed MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, ensuring that AI agents operate within strict security boundaries while maintaining a frictionless developer experience. This work spans custom DevPod providers for Oracle Cloud, secure tunneling architectures, and production-grade container isolation -- all open-sourced and battle-tested across client engagements at DevNinja / OpsNinja.

**Technologies**: DevContainers, DevPod, Docker, Oracle Cloud, MCP, Cloudflare Tunnels, Traefik
